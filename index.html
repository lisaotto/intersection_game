    <h2> The Rules</h2>
    <p>You must succesfully negotiate intersections in order to get to the farthest in the game. Interpret the signals and decide if you'll follow them or not. But be careful. If your partner decides to ignore their signal as well you'll end up going backwards.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>On each round turn your phone vertically and place in on your forehead without looking.</li>
      <li>Look at the signal on your partner's forehead and decide if you'll move you're piece (only one space, please!) in accordance with the signal or not. Move quickly though &mdash; you only have 5 seconds to decide!</li>
      <li>After each round take a look to see who followed the their signal and who didn't. Move your pieces the propoer amount of points based on the players' actions.</li>
      <li>First one to the final destination wins!</li>
    </ul>
